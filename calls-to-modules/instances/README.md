#Multiple Polymorphic Instantiations of the same Terraform Modules        
        
Multiple instantiations of the same modules will be managed by automation that will create copies in this directory of the calls to each module.        
        
Placing copies here of the calls will make it easier for terraform to manage state separately for each instance of the same modules.
